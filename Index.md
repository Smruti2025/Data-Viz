PLOT 1: BAR CHART OF LICENSE COUNTS BY TYPE
What’s Being Visualized:
For my first plot, I chose a bar chart showing the number of licenses for each License Type. This helps us quickly compare how frequently each category appears in the dataset. Each bar corresponds to a license type along the x-axis, and the bar height represents the count of rows in that category. I decided on a bar chart to give a clear visual ranking of the most common versus least common license types.

Encodings, Color, Data Transformations
Encodings: I used x=License Type and y=count() to map the categories to the horizontal axis and their frequencies to the vertical axis.

Color Choices: Each bar is colored by License Type so that viewers can quickly distinguish the different categories if bars are close in height. The default color palette works well for these discrete categories; a custom palette wasn’t strictly necessary, so I used Altair’s built-in color scheme.

Data Transformations: In Python, I dropped any rows with missing “Original Issue Date” or “License Type” to avoid errors. Aside from that filtering, I did not need additional transformations for this aggregate bar chart.

PLOT 2: INTERACTIVE MONTLY LICENSE TRENDS
What’s Being Visualized:For my second plot, I created a time-series line chart that displays how many licenses were issued each month, grouped by License Type. The x-axis shows the Month (derived from the “Original Issue Date”), and the y-axis indicates the count of licenses. This reveals potential trends and fluctuations over time. Because there can be many different license types, I added a dropdown that allows the viewer to select a specific License Type to view its monthly pattern in isolation.

Encodings, Color, Data Transformations, Interactivity
Encodings: I encoded Month (on the x-axis) and count() on the y-axis, using color to distinguish the currently selected License Type. Points are also shown on the line to highlight each data value for that month.

Color Choices: The line is color-coded by License Type to stay consistent with the bar chart’s color usage. In practice, only one type is displayed at a time, so the color helps emphasize that category’s series on the chart.

Data Transformations: First, I converted each “Original Issue Date” to a datetime, then extracted just the month (e.g., df['Month'] = df['Original Issue Date'].dt.to_period('M')). After dropping rows where these fields were missing, I aggregated the data by (License Type, Month) to get counts.

Interactivity: I used Altair’s parameter binding approach with a dropdown to filter by License Type. This lets the user explore each category’s monthly trends without crowding the chart with too many lines at once. The interactivity makes the visualization more interesting because it provides on-demand detail: we can quickly switch among categories to see if some have big spikes in certain months while others remain steady.


Together, these two plots offer both a static comparison (bar chart) and an interactive time-series perspective. The interactivity—especially the dropdown filter—makes it easier to isolate the patterns of interest without overwhelming the viewer. By selecting a specific License Type, we avoid visual clutter and can see monthly trends clearly. This level of control helps the audience dig deeper into the data on their own.
